You are working in the Divinity: Original Sin 2 (DefEd) workspace, primarily on forging-system documentation under:
- Data/Mods/forging_system_d581d214-2dd4-4690-bb44-e371432f1bfc/Story/RawFiles/Docs/

Scope
- Apply these rules ONLY when editing files under the forging-system Docs folder above.
- Do not apply these rules to other `Data/` documentation or other mods unless the user explicitly asks.

Language
- Use British English (en-GB) in all new prose and new comments.
- Do not rename existing identifiers/IDs/anchors/filenames to change spelling.

File creation / diffs
- Do not create new Markdown (.md) files unless the user explicitly asks for a new doc. Prefer editing existing docs.
- Keep diffs minimal and avoid stylistic churn.

Approval gate (non-trivial changes only)
- For non-trivial edits (restructure, cross-section renumbering, anchor/TOC sweeps, or broad terminology rewrites):
  - First summarise what will change, which sections/anchors will be affected, and what link/TOC updates are required.
  - Wait for explicit user approval before applying changes.
- Trivial edits (typos, single-line fixes) may be applied directly.

Documentation style (match existing forging-system Docs conventions)
- Preserve existing section numbering, titles, and overall layout unless the user explicitly requests a restructure.
- Preserve existing explicit anchor IDs (`<a id="..."></a>`). If a section is moved/renamed, keep the old anchor ID where feasible; otherwise add a compatibility anchor.
- When adding a new section that needs linking, add an explicit `<a id="..."></a>` directly under the heading, following existing patterns.
- Use '---' separators between major blocks where the surrounding doc uses them.
- Prefer bullet lists for rules/notes. Use tables for caps/probability matrices when appropriate.
- Use backticks for variables, IDs, filenames, and keys (e.g., `OverallCap`, `forgeSeed`, `WeaponType`).

Contents toggle pattern (`inheritance_system.md`-specific)
- If editing `inheritance_system.md`: keep the top-level Contents `<details>` toggle wrapping ONLY the TOC list, not the whole document body.
- If you add/remove/renumber sections, update the Contents list and all internal links accordingly.

Forging-system terminology & examples (when touching inheritance/rarity docs)
- Treat Blue Stats, ExtraProperties, and Skills as separate modifier channels that share one overall rollable-slot cap (e.g., 5 for Divine by default).
- Keep notation consistent with the doc (e.g., `S` / `P_size` / `P` / `F` and channel-specific variants).
- Ensure worked examples respect caps:
  - Divine overall cap defaults to 5.
  - If a probability table includes outcomes exceeding the cap, collapse them into a `5+` bucket (or cap+ bucket) per the doc’s convention.
  - Respect the parent max-modifier cap constraints described in the doc when constructing “real examples”.
